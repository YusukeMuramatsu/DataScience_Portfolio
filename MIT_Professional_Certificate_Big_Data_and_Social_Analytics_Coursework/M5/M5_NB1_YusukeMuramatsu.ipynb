Subsequent sections briefly demonstrate bandicoot's visualization capabilities, how to use bandicoot in combination with network and graph content introduced in Module 4 as well as error handling and loading files from a directory. The content of this notebook demonstrates the steps in isolation and will will move to an end-to-end example in notebook 2 of Module 5.\n",

A pilot phase of 55 participants was launched in March 2010. In September 2010, phase two of the study included 130 participants - approximately 64 families. Participants were selected out of approximately 200 applicants in a way that would achieve a representative sample of the community and sub-communities (Aharony et al. 2011).\n",

    "In order to better understand the process of creating features (referred to as behavioral indicators in bandicoot), you will start by manually creating a feature. Creating features is a tedious process, and using libraries such as bandicoot can significantly reduce the time required to generate features that you would use as input in machine learning algorithms. It is important for you to both understand the process and ensure that the results produced by the libraries are as expected. In other words, you need to make sure that you use the correct function from the library to produce the expected results.\n",

This function has been demonstrated in earlier notebooks as it is extremely useful when you need to get a quick view of a dataset without loading it. Should the contents prove useful, you can load it as a dataframe."

    "## 2.2 Using Bandicoot\n",

Although it is outside of the scope of this course, it is important to start considering memory utilization, reproducibility of results, and reuse of intermediate steps when working with large datasets. Toolboxes such as Bandicoot are both optimized for improved performance and specific to mobile phone metadata analysis, meaning that the functions available are specific to the type of data to be analyzed.\n",

    "This section contains network indicators, a gender assortativity example, and a brief demonstration on how to use Bandicoot to generate input for visualizations using NetworkX. You started the course with Professor Pentland describing general patterns in behavior that are observed between individuals. Understanding the individual as a part of a network is an extremely useful way to evaluate how they resemble or do not resemble their friends, as well as the role they play in their network or community.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our current dataset, “Friends and Family”, the majority of interactions take place outside of the population in the study, therefore performing the calculations on this dataset does not make sense. This is because the data is not representative of the full network of contacts. In a commercial application you would most likely encounter a similar situation as there are multiple carriers, each with only a portion of the total market share. The figures differ per country but typically fall in the range of 10-30% market share for the main (dominant) carriers.\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to prepare a separate, trimmed, dataset to demonstrate this example.\n",
    "\n",
    "A useful feature of Bandicoot, is that it is very quick to analyze a user's ego network, or individual focus node, if the input data is properly formatted. You start by loading the \"ego\" in question to a Bandicoot object. You need to set the network parameter to \"True\". Bandicoot will attempt to extract all \"ego\" interaction data, as well as do the network analysis for the data contained in the specified network folder."

Even though I assumed that the number should be bigger than 50% by intuition(just because I have seen many people interact with the same gender friends), I think that it is still meaningful data. With my intuition, I thought the same gender could have 90%+ assortativity, but the fact that 71.4% of contacts share the same values seems somewhat lower than I expected.  Since the data set includes family, the number could have been lowered a bit.(Assuming son interacts with mom and daughter interacts with dad every day) If the data was collected from friend community, the gender assortativity may be much higher.
