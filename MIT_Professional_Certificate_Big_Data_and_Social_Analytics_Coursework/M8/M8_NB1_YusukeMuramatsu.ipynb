Keep in mind that typical studies, whether in academic or in commercial applications, typically do not follow a straight path. As a result of this, the output is typically produced after many iterations, deviations, and potential changes in course. Living labs are longitudinal and adaptive by nature. In science, researchers uncover insights that may be different from what they originally anticipated, and in business individuals may uncover new and unexpected business and improvement opportunities. You need to ensure that you spend enough time in the exploration phase of real-life projects, while ensuring that you deliver actionable results in the required timeframes. A good approach is to start with a minimum viable product and add features to this product as your project matures."

    "If I could testify that Tokyo's current transportation system cannot handle increased traffic during the Olympic, I would propose that Tokyo offers shuttle buses and bike rental system. In my opinion, since Olympic traffic spike is a temporal event, Tokyo should not invest in train system, which could cost the city significant amount of money and time. Also after the Olympic, I would assume that not so many people would use the line(because there not many offices/schools in the area) so it is hard to recoup the initial investment. Most of the subway system in Tokyo run shallow ground level. Therefore, if Tokyo wants to open a new line, they need to dig deep in the ground which would cost extra money and which makes it harder to reach the break-even point. So my suggestion would be that Tokyo offers shuttle buses and bikes. Shuttle busses are relatively cheap compared to opening up a new train system. Additional shuttle bus service might increase traffic congestion, so Tokyo has to consider traffic regulation (such as no commuting with a car without permission) to smoothen the traffic as much as it can. Also, the bike would be a good idea. As implemented in NYC, citi-bike help avoid unnecessary traffic congestion. Tokyo is small enough to bike around, so I would think that bike system could be a good solution to the problem."
